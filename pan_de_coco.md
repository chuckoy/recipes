# Utensils/Kitchenware

## Core
* 1/2 tsp
* 1/2 tbsp
* 1 cup
* 1/4 cup
* cling wrap / clean kitchen towels

## Optional
* stand mixer with dough hook

# Ingredients

## Dough
* 4 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 7 grams instant dry yeast
* 1/2 cup sunflower oil (or vegetable oil)
* 1/2 tsp salt

## Filling
* 2 cups desiccated coconut
* 1/2 cup sugar (white or brown)
* 1 cup milk
* 3 tbsp butter
* 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp flour
* 1/4 cup milk

## Egg Wash
* 1 egg
* 1 tbsp water

# Steps
1. Mix flour and sugar in a large bowl
2. Add the instant dry yeast, then mix.
3. Add the lukewarm milk, vegetable oil, and salt. Mix with spatula until the ingredients stick together and form a dough.
4. Knead for 5 minutes, or use a stand mixer with dough hook. Avoid adding more flour in the mixture. Apply oil on your hands if the dough is too sticky or add more oil if the dough is too dry.
5. Grease a clean bowl and place the dough. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or cling wrap. Leave it to rest for at least 30-60 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.
6. Prepare the filling by combining desiccated coconut, (brown) sugar, coconut milk, water, butter, and vanilla extract in a pan. Bring to a simmer over lower heat.
7. Cook until the filling is more compact, and the liquids are mostly absorbed. You could add 1 tbsp of flour dissoved in 1/4 cup of milk onto the mixture if you wish for it to be more compact and sticky. Stir regulary for another 2-3 minutes.
8. Remove filling from heat and let it cool.
9. Gently deflate the dough, and put it in a flat surface. Roll the dough into a log and cut into half. Continue rolling and cutting until you get 24 equal parts.
10. Cover the dough pieces with kitchen towel for 3-5 minutes.
11. Flatten each dough with the palm of the hand. Add about 1 tablespoon of coconut filling in the center. 
12. *Dumplify* then pinch the corners together to fully enclose the filling. 
13. Arrange the filled dough, pinched-side down, on a baking sheet at about 1 inch apart.
14. Poke small holes in the center of each filled dough using fork. 
15. Cover with kitchen towel and let them rest for another 20-30 minutes.
16. Bake in a 340 F oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with egg wash. Return to oven and bake for another 5 minutes or until golden brown
